# ETL_Pipeline_Airflow

# Project Overview 
The objective of this project is to build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow for orchestrating the workflow, Docker for containerizing the environment, and PostgreSQL for storing the transformed data. The ETL pipeline will fetch weather data from an API, perform necessary transformations using Python, and load the processed data into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.
